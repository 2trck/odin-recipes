    </p>

    <b>Cooking Instructions</b>

    <p>
      1. **Make the Meat Sauce:** - Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large
      skillet over medium heat. - Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery,
      sauté until softened (about 5 minutes). - Add the garlic and cook for
      another minute. - Increase the heat and add the ground beef, cooking until
      browned and fully cooked (break it up as it cooks). - Once browned, stir
      in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, beef broth (or water), and red wine
      (if using). - Add oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. -
      Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30-40 minutes, stirring
      occasionally. The sauce should thicken. 2. **Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:**
      - In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. - Add the flour
      and stir constantly for about 1-2 minutes to form a roux. - Gradually
      whisk in the milk, making sure there are no lumps. - Continue cooking,
      stirring often, until the sauce thickens (about 5-7 minutes). - Season
      with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. - Set aside. 3. **Assemble the
      Lasagna:** - Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). - Spread a thin layer of
      the meat sauce on the bottom of a large baking dish. - Place a layer of
      lasagna sheets over the sauce. - Spread another layer of meat sauce over
      the sheets, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce. - Sprinkle some
      shredded mozzarella cheese on top. - Repeat the layering process (sheets,
      meat sauce, béchamel, mozzarella) until you've used up the ingredients.
      The final layer should be a generous topping of béchamel sauce,
      mozzarella, and grated Parmesan. 4. **Bake:** - Cover the baking dish with
      aluminum foil (lightly oiled so it doesn’t stick to the cheese). - Bake
      for 25 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for another 20-25
      minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly. 5. **Rest and Serve:** -
      Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before
      slicing. - Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
